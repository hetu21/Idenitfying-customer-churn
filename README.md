Customer Churn Data
Customer churn is a major problem and one of the most important concerns
for large companies. Here, Customer churn is a financial term that refers to
the loss of a client or customer—that is, when a customer ceases to interact
with a company or business. Due to the direct effect on the revenues of the
companies, especially in the telecom field, companies are seeking to develop
means to predict potential customer to churn. Low churn rates mean happy
customers; high churn rates mean customers are leaving. Therefore having a
robust and accurate churn prediction model helps businesses to take actions
to prevent customers from leaving the company.
